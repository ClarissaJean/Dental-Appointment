# Background of the Study

  Project Entitled “Dental Appointment: Application-based-Android used for  an appointment for Dental Procedures at Dental Clinic” 
  Got this Idea to experience getting an appointment schedule in the dental clinic that we always visit. That is manually calling and text  to their mobile number and  setting an appointment. Problem in the side of patients is that some of it hustle to them rather than doing  important things. It's time consuming to set an appointment. On the side of Staff in some small-scale clinics having usually only few staff and booking of dental treatment are always full. Because of shortage of staff , This often leads to some patients calling to set an appointment or any concerns will not answer their call. 

The Project Application, aims to provide the patients, proper app to easily set for dental appointments on their android phone/ mobile phone online.It is an mobile application.The goal is to help staff in  managing desirable and accurate appointments.
